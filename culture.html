      Despite being a Hindu festival, the Thrissur Pooram is attended
      by different sections of Kerala society. Several replicas of
      the festival are held in places in Kerala as well as outside
      the state

      Thrissur Pooram is considered one of the greatest gatherings in
      Asia. It has an important place in the tourism map of India, as
      tourists enjoy the beauty and traditions of this pooram. Rail and
      bus connectivity is excellent in Thrissur, which attracts many
      foreign tourists to the gala. It is considered as meeting of Devas
      (ദേവ സംഗമം).

      The Oscar-winning sound editor Resul Pookutty and his team recorded
      the sounds of the 36-hour festivities and made a movie The Sound
      Story.
